I would ever beA trusting, loving child to thee:As comes to me or cloud or sun,Father! thy will, not mine, be done!Oh, ne'er will I at life repine:Enough that thou hast made it mine.When falls the shadow cold of deathI yet will sing, with parting breath,As comes to me or shade or sun,Father! thy will, not mine, be done!"
